# Project Brief

The members of the **Cow** collective are interested in having a website of their own. Read the following brief description on the proposed website:

The members of the **Bull Power** collective are dairy manufacturers in the Nelson region who market their own dairy product namely **Cheese** separately to domestic and global customers.

We need a website for the Nelson region for members of the collective that would increase exposure for the individual members for the collective benefit of all of the dairy manufacturers.

We liked the website of Wine Nelson (winenelson.co.nz) and envision a site with write ups about each **dairy** manufacturer and what they produce and sell with a link to their websites, if any, and contact information for each grower.

The purpose of the new website is to increase the market share of **dairy** manufacturers and increase profit by reducing supply chain costs and securing direct product supply contracts with domestic and global customers.
To achieve our goal, we would like to have an online auction function on our website. The website needs some homepage text about general information of our products such as types, characteristics, processing information, quality factor, usage and benefit.

Then, the **dairy** manufacturer details could sit under that.
We would want each **dairy** manufacturer to provide the types, attributes and grades of their products, as well as contact information.

We require the following features on the website:

* Members and customers can log in and administer their account
* Members use the auction system to register their products, and customers use the auction system to bid
* Interactive element(s) that engages the website user
* A web-based product quality calculator that prices the products based on its characteristics.
  For example, berries may be priced according to size, taste, yield, colour, nutritional value, i.e. sugar content, vitamin C strength.
