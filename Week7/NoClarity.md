## Web assignment 2

To start, the purpose of a web framework is reasonably easy to write a few words about.

Followed by the next part and that is to write up an evaluation of three chosen web frameworks systems for the use on the project, an auction website featuring:

- login / User Authentication
- Information in a particular style
- They connect to databases
- Render certain information
- They have profiles that can be viewed

Each framework is to be evaluated as described in the following:

- Include screenshots that demonstrate prototype solutions that meet website requirements.
- How to evaluate your web frameworks.
- Identify three web framework systems.
- Install each web framework system

## Issues

- **The above reads to install all 3 frameworks** - _Understood_
- **Identify 3 web framework systems** 
- **How to evaluate your web frameworks** _is this referring to the "Security in Open Source Web Content Management Systems" Meike table. I have transfer a replica table to my project._
- **Include screenshots that demonstrate prototype solutions that meet website requirements** _now this one is the kicker the website requirements are listed at the top. Would this imply and going by the provided marking grid in the course outline that we are to whip up 3! auction websites using a database to retrieve user details and bid on items, find a calculator and import it into our works then work out how to do a login for 3 different web frameworks. Are we required to do 3 fully functional auction websites using 3 different frameworks?_

## What have I learnt

I learnt that when it comes to code the word "Framework" is widely used and typically falls into three categories:

- Frontend
- Backend
- CSS or user interface frameworks

  Websites tend to share similar structures as a developer after a while this becomes obvious and this is when frameworks have come to make the web world easier to develop. If you had the choice to write the code everytime you want to build a new application OR use a web framework to make it easier to achieve the same common structure by importing all those special features that are readily available to be used minus alot of the effort - it would make sense to use a framework to start the heavy lifting.Making more time for developers to work on other areas of the code saving precious time.

There is much to learn and I am thinking it could be a big ask to build 3 auction websites that do not need to look pretty but need functionality and then figure out 3 different web frameworks with little guidance

## What will I do to fill in any gaps in my understanding

* Contact the tutor to help with my chosen frameworks - possibly Vue.js framework, Express framework, React Native a JS framework, Spring a Java framework and ... well will need to go for a search.
* find auction tutorials on each chosen framework if one is available
* i am thinking more than the 4hrs a week own time required for this web7 paper will need to be 30 hrs a week somehow
* I will need to do some reading on this, its the title refering to CMS not web frameworks that has me stumped but it is highly possible this could be adapted

Currently thinking this is ridiculous
