### Laravel framework
Tutor has spoke often of the Laravel framework in many classes going on to provide tutorials that are expected to be done. Laravel is not a framework we are required to use for milestone 2 hand in but is recommended by the tutor saying wordpress and PHP are highly sort after in the job industry. Laravel uses PHP and Java, therefore giving the tutorial a go will give me a teeny bit of insight into the world of PHP and Java.

Spent three hours trying to install Laravel â€“ to install Laravel you need to install a composer but to install the composer you need to install something else, the instructions on the Linda tutorial are not instructional for this newbie developer. After spending a very long time on this, watching many different YouTube clips resulted in no installation of Laravel and unable to experience any of the features Laravel has to offer. Therefore, in my experience Laravel is not the easiest to implement and would not recommend. 

Highlighting my issues to the tutor Todd resulted in .... null. No problem, moving on to a JavaScript framework is best.

### CMS Word press
Todd speaks highly of using wordpress. Possibly an option for a developer who does not wish to code or is short on time. Wordpress or Wix are not options for us due to the paper being a framework paper not a CMS paper. What is great to know is that there are Content Management Systems available if we need to use them. The Tutor has mentioned when we learn to build the prototypes with 3 different frameworks required for milestone 2, building an auction site from scratch for final project will be easy and we will not need to resort to a CMS.  

### MERN stack
Currently learning - Mongo db, Express, React and node.js on top of this may need to look into state management like Redux, install Insomnia an HTTP request software to test http requests. 

Previous experience with React is minimal having experiencing javascript for the first time last year in my web601 class, neither had I heard of the popular React web framework or the http request software POSTMAN or INSOMNIA, many class members had no accounts with Github or our accounts were inactive. Therefore the tutor had to give crash courses for the prequisites for web601 paper to get everyone up to speed to complete the semester with a bang! Revisiting React is going to be a great refresher and learning Mongo db a no SQL database will be a first plus a better understanding of Express will enhance my knowledge for the web world.

To start finding a tutorial that begins with a blank canvas is few and far between - currently working through a basic tutorial to familiarise myself with Javascript and how to route to pages and retrieve data from Mongo db atlas.  

## Todo list:

- [x] Understand Express.js _currently using Express not quite fully understanding as of yet_
- [x] [Install Express.js](<(https://github.com/terlici/base-express)>) - **_this is a git repo with express_**
- [ ] login and authenticaton - _finding a suitable tutorial_
- [x] Buff out a section in the report - _assignment3 completed Introduction_
- [x] Have a nose at some of the provided resources - Moodle, some of these resources need to be removed
- [ ] find another framework to look into _choosing between Angular or Vue.js_
- [x] Start a REact tutorial - _found a great MERN stack tutorial_
