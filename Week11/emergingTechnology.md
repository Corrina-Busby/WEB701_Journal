### Emerging Technology

Today in class the tutor discussed emerging technology namely **chatbots**. This is because for Milestone 3 part 2 we are required to emerge a leading technology into our websites.

Another hot topic covered today, top leading frameworks in 2020. Great to see React leading the pack on "this" poll.

Resources provided by the tutor: there are too many to get through. Deno was one introduced to us and the only one I have heard a little bit about. Deno is basically another Node.js it is very new and not recommended to use at this stage and that is coming from the creator Ryan Dahl himself who also created node.js. Deno is not ready to be used as a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript due to many bugs and fixes but, is available for a bit of a play. 

Currently I have no time to investigate further due to having already implemented the MERN and MEVN stacks which both use Node.js. however, JavaScript and the web platform are evolving and TypeScript has changed the way applications are developed, Deno has been created to handle these changes.

## Study time

Have spent 3 weeks straight no other studying but web trying to learn JavaScript, Express backend, React and Vue frontend and Mongo database. On top of that the report that is difficult to write due to it not fitting a web frameworks has taken considerable ammount of time.

## To do list:

- [x] Understand Express.js
- [x] [Install Express.js](<(https://github.com/terlici/base-express)>) - **_this is a git repo with express_**
- [ ] login and authenticaton - _React needs to be modified_
- [ ] Write the report - prototypes- _5 to go_
- [ ] Have a nose at some of the provided resources - More and more resources to look at
- [x] find another framework to look into _Vue_
- [x] Start a React tutorial
- [x] Think of an emerging technology and write a proposal
