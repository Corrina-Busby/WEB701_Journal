### Deployment

First class - connecting to the apache2 server and rendering a file with some words.
The class was not recorded therefore I am unable to use as a valuable resource. Unable to proceed because I have no idea what that class was trying to show me.

Second class - same as above connecting to the apache2 server and installing and rendering an App: Express, React and Laravel
I am having issues trying to install frontend frameworks: React and Vue, on creating the Vue App using {\$ vue create client}I receive an error: Unable to access jarfile

React is a bit better, when I open the path in the browser the React App is grabbing the html file but not the React App the problem being the **bundle** not loading inside the body.

### Take homes

Being informed their is a tutorial -0 to help me deploy a framework to the server. Great advice and good to know but, can I find tutorial -0... nope.
Advised to "google it", this is not new to me. "Where to install a frontend js framework: React or Vue on Apache2 server?" First of all, my question is **NOT about HOW to install React or Vue**. In the default web folder of the apache webserver (/var/www/) it seems I am lost and my question is where should I install the React or Vue App or what is usual way to build it.
