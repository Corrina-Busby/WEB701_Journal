## What is Express.js 

Express.js is a Node.js web application server framework and can also be used to create APIs in Node.js. Node.js is used to build the server side, the input and output are event driven, APIs of Node.js are non-blocking meaning server will not wait for the return of data requests before it starts on the next request. Instead it will start on a new API making Node.js very scalable and asynchronous.

**Express.js** is a small **Node.js** framework of web application: 
* Express.js is built on Node.js 
* whereas Node.js is built on Google's V8 engine. 
* To use Express.js we install Node.js. 
* Express.js is written in Javascript 
* whereas Node.js is written in C, C++ and JavaScript
* Express.js is the de facto standard server framework for **node**

## M.V.C
Express.js the Controllers are **provided** it supports View and Model.
Node.js the Controllers are **NOT provided** and does **NOT** support View Model.

## Installing Express in Class Live Tutorial
Today in class tutor Dr Todd is to take us through the installation and passing of http requests using Express.js thus' showing us how to use it with our web applications. Some of the class previously installed Express.js using the npm command however, for those who had not were instructed to go throught the process of installing Node.js a requirement for installing and applying Express.js while the tutor carried out his lecture on Express.js.

Tutor explained we needed the latest the Node.js to run Express.js - Many in class only months ago had a version that would run Express.js therefore, we are all good to go apart from the folks that have yet to install Node.js and catch up with the lesson.

Dr Todd then spoke for a big a part of the lesson about Pug.js, Pug.js is what the tutor is using to demo Express.js, would appear this is his 1st time he is using Pug.js. I still remain clueless of what Pug.js is and for me it has nothing to do with my website. Is this a requirement? then the tutor should let me know otherwise it is just something unfamilliar to throw me off track for a little bit during this class. Pug.js is very Python was mentioned by the tutor several times and the script we were viewing on the projector a little cringy - I had a look into Python after class it would appeared nothing like what we viewed in class however, we are not here today to learn Python we are about Express.js and **what we all wanted to know is how Express.js will pass data to and from a server!**.
 
The tutor went through the folder structure from the Express.js boilerplate. I have to say was sooooo confusing I have no idea what the tutor was trying to show me. Unfortunately missing the part on how this all fits into my web app and how are we to pass data. I actually came out of class none the wiser. The after class talk with one other who installed Express.js with this Pug.js said his was not working. There was no focus on Routes and how we are to handle multiple different http requests at a specified url.

**Uncertainty** is the word of the day. 
It would appear I will need to go home and make time to figure this out on my own. Some guidance will be sort after if it is possible so not waste too many days on something that may not be required.
