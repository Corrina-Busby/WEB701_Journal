## Express.js Vs Node.js 
Express.js is used to build web applications using principles of Node.js and can also be used to create APIs in Node.js. Node.js is used to build the server side, the input and output are event driven, APIs of Node.js are non-blocking meaning server will not wait for the return of data requests before it starts on the next request. Instead it will start on a new API making Node.js very scalable.

**Express.js** is a small **Node.js** framework of web application: 
* Express.js is built on Node.js 
* whereas Node.js is built on Google's V8 engine. 
* To use Express.js we install Node.js. 
* Express.js is written in Javascript 
* whereas Node.js is written in C, C++ and JavaScript

## M.V.C
Express.js the Controllers are **provided** it supports View and Model.
Node.js the Controllers are **NOT provided** and does **NOT** support View Model.

## Installing Express in Class Live Tutorial
Today in class tutor Dr Todd is to take us through the installation of Express.js and show us how to use it with our web applications but instead showed us how to install the Express.js Hello World I think and I say I think because I never installed anything, the class was not a hands on learning tutorial, therefore if you have never used Express.js or not comfortable or familliar with Express.js, today's lesson is going to be of any benefit for your web app. 
It was explained that it is important to make sure you have the latest node.js installed, what I had worked but I installed the latest version while in class. There was something about Pug.js, no idea what Pug.js has to do with my website and do I need to know. The tutor spoke a bit about Pug.js being very Python and I have never seen or used Python. Which explains the script I was viewing on the projector a little cringy but we are not here today to learn Python we are about Express.js and how Express.js will pass data to and from a server... I think! 
 
The tutor went through the folder structure from the Express.js boilerplate. I have to say was sooooo confusing I have no idea what that was all about. Unfortunately missing the part on how this all fits into my web app and how are we to pass data. I actually came out of class none the wiser. The after class talk with one other who installed Express.js with this Pug.js said his was not working.
