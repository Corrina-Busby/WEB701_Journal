## Web701 slideshow connecting to server
Tutor walked through a slide show - not the easiest to understand. The expectation may have been to follow along and perform the exercise during class. This is something I attempted, unfortunately there were no prep tasks for this or live demonstration just some slides that do not reflect the actual outcome. 

Need a better way to help guide the class on this as there are currently many issues.

The purpose of the class was to show us how to connect to our linux virtual machines and the tutors server, the server is run in a virtual environment. For future use, we will deploy our web frameworks application into this virtual environment. To be honest I'm not even sure I have that correct. I have not done anything like this prior, this is all very new to me. 

To start I do not understand anything that was taught in class today, therefore, I cannot comment on what was being taught.

What I did do in my own time was reach out to a classmate who kindly took the time to show me todays class step by step in 5-10 mins furthermore, we opened WinScp app and had a play on there assuming that is going to be what Todd will present in next weeks class.

Overall it was not as complicated as demonstrated via Teams app to connect to the server, there appears to be some issues which are difficult to explain but it appears I am in a different environment when I make a change with the file in WinSCP it does not change on the server. When I make a change using the cmd prompt as shown by the tutor the changes are instant. Puzzled to understand why this is happening. 
I googled around to no avail and decided to put it to rest and wait for Todds next online class. 

## What will I do to fill in any gaps in my understanding
* Turn up to the next class and find out why it feels I am in two different environments when trying to make a change on the WINscp app
* To start, is to overcome the teaching and learn to try and understand what the tutor is expecting or what he wants and not be defeated with fluid generalized feedback, take the essential notes and work with them.
* The answer is to go and find out on my own
* Asking classmates if they have the spare time
* Possibly ask last years web601 tutor
