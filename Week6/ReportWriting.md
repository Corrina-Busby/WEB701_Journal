## Report time

This report is extensive and is taking a lot longer than anticipated making it very difficult to get started on it this week. Above all that I have yet to look into frameworks and fully understand what it is the tutor requires it appears that there are a tonne of resources that need revisted. They are not quite user friendly so to speak i.e the unsecure link A Brief History of Information Architecture was not engaging and had me asleep in seconds. Yes I could go and find my own content but did I ....no <br><br>
_The mission is to finish off the Site Goals section and look into a Framework for assignment 2_

## Site Goals

**Intended Audiences** will cover the relationship between Business-to-Consumer and why will people come to the Website. The overall reason people will will come to the site is to make money and essentially buy cheap cheese.
To gain an understanding of the intended audiences the following will be researched:

- Intended Local Businesses
  - Will look at a couple of local businesses
- Consumers
  - Find reason why consumers will use Bull Power auctions
- Business-to-Business
  - The interactions between small to medium dairy manufacturers like Supermarket brokers and Restaurants

On top of this, by becoming a member, members can take advantage of using the registered businesses which includes traceability ad better selection of goods. Therefore the site will need to be able to deliver a user/customer's general requirements.

Working on the Site Goals is an indepth topic that one could spend weeks on to fully gouge the lengths needed to go to, to successfully understand. From my research I barely scrape the surface of what each role entails and would to investigate more but for now finishing this section amicably is all that is required.

I run out of time this week to look into frameworks - I shall put it on the TODO list

## Todo list:

- [ ] Understand Express.js _arrg no time for this_
- [x] [Install Express.js](<(https://github.com/terlici/base-express)>) - **_this is a git repo with express_**
- [ ] login and authenticaton - _Need to make time to have a play_
- [x] Buff out a section in the report - assignment2 completed Site Goals
- [x] Have a nose at some of the provided resources - Moodle, some of these resources need to be removed
- [ ] find another framework to look into _yet to look into this_
- [x] Start a REact tutorial
