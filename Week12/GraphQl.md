## Emerging Technology Title
GraphQl for my Vue.js framework: How to deliver information to enhance the end-user experience.
#### __Goal__
The goal will be to precisely offer data to users delivered through GraphQl. Information the end-user wants without the system having to send multiple REST calls to receive the same outcome.
GraphQl is one the attest technologies in web deb it is a query language for APIs and a server-side runtime for performing queries on existing data. It gives the end- user exactly what they asked for or need and nothing more, not only is GraphQl predictable but also controls the data it gets, not the server. 
It is possible apps using GraphQl are faster even on slow mobile network connections, stable and provides an understandable description of the data in your API making it easier and more flexible for a developer to make changes in the future.
#### __Research__ 
1.  Understanding of GraphQl is needed 

2.	Implementing GraphQl
3.	End-users – feedback is essential for the success of emerging technology into an application
#### __Development__ 
__Build a website__ 
1.	Create a project using a web framework Express for backend and Vue for frontend

2.	Work through the processes with GraphQl
3.	Evaluate its effectiveness
4.	Functionality assessment – running the app
5.	Create a database of auction items

Evaluate and analyse results against related work and document the findings for the final report

Write the final 800-1000-word report detailing my implementation of the web technology into my project.
#### __Skills required__
* Understanding how backend, server-side, and frontend web development data flows 
* Building a website – yet to ever build a website with web-frameworks
* Investing in Tutorials from Lynda.com, Udemy and YouTube to learn the required skills to get me through
* I need to learn how to use the emerging technology required for the web701 final website build
#### __Time management__
* Tutor may assist and stress my timeframes
* Planer is required
#### __Skills__
* I have completed some component prototypes in React.js, Express.js and Vue.js these are simply prototyping, not websites
* Last semester started a website in React.js, it is unfinished.
* Google search – I am capable of google if there is anything this bachelor has taught me so far is you really need to learn how to google, this is a self-taught skill therefore, up to interpretation.
#### __Timeline__
The final project has been assigned 30 hours in total over a 3-week timeframe. During this time, I have other assignments due to complete my bachelor. It would appear time restrictions will be tight and not doable. 
Not quite sure how I will build a website with unfamiliar web-frameworks and emerge a modern technology GraphQl into the non-existing website with very little time.
