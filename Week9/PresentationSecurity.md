## Security Presentation
Provided with many links to look into, if I get time I will take a look at some of these.
This class was about the security of Content Management Systems(CMS) we are doing Web Frameworks but the same lesson applies to the web frameworks we are comparing for assignment 2.

The quickest scan on the many links provided were interesting some will need a bit more indepth searching to find what I am looking for - As sugessted by a classmate, Github is also a good place to look for finding any security issues.

One link provided on an issue on mongoDb was a tad outdated 2015 that this is not an issue in 2020. The lesson taught here will be to use an updated version and update when the latest patch is released.

What I have gathered from today's class is to take the provided graph off the Moodle website, edit the CMS headers, replace with web frameworks and do some google research and fill in the table to the best of my ability. 

## ToDo
* have a scan of the links 
* draw up the skeleton Security table and edit headers to web frameworks I am comparing 
* Start working on some prototypes
