## Frameworks
When it comes to code, the word “Framework” is widely used, and typically falls into three categories.
*	Frontend
*	Backend
*	CSS or user interface frameworks

Basically, frameworks are code libraries, other peoples’ code, with many developers preferring open source so that they can look at the code online. There are many JS frameworks and many libraries.

Firstly front-end, these developers build and design the interface deciding how the site looks to end-users. Using a front-end framework can make developing your application easier but, each framework has a set of rules on how a developer should structure their CSS (layout), HTML (content) and JavaScript (behavior). You can choose to ignore the frameworks manner and preferred rules set and write the JavaScript however you please though you may run into issues. 

Intuitively, the flipside to front-end framework is the backend framework aka server-side web frameworks. Backend web frameworks such as Express.js, Spring boot and Django can help protect the APIs ( Application Programming Interfaces) from third-party attacks, authorizing users, seamless interaction with chosen database, routing URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to deliver preferred content to the end-user. In a nutshell if your backend developer is looking to make life easier a backend framework can help with more than the above noted tasks.
## Mongo DB & Express backend framework
Applying a backend framework with pre-configured tools and templates can assist in fast tracking development allowing for more time spent on other tasks. 

Being one of the most important components of the MERN and MEVN stack, Express backend framework is a routing API allowing me to build REST API to build the routes for the website. Express integrates well with Mongo DB a No-SQL database or relational database like MySQL with ease.
## CSS,Vuetify, Bootstrap
Vuetify is a Material Design component library for Vue framework, the aim for my web app is to provide end-users with rich and engaging web applications and using Vuetify for Vue wouud have accomplished this unfortunately being alittle scattered with all the new technologies I dabbled in Bootstrap, Vue Bootstrap, Vuetify, CSS grid, transitions, animation and who knows what else. This became challenging with all the different rule sets for each, a little messy and not reccomended to add too many different styling resources if this is all new to you. 
## VueX
Unbeknown to myself I had not realised this was a statemanagment like Redux is for React. I thought it was another styling bootstrap tech similar to Vuetify. Once VueX was in action within my code, I was commited and the fact having hooked up the backend and database then completing my nav, login and registration, I did not want to start registration, login process over again due to the time it took me to make this victory milestone. 
## GraphQL
GraphQL, to start I really thought emerging GraphQL would be a nightmare. Turns out once you get your head around Resolvers and Schemas and randomely placing the required code to get GraphQL hitting your endpoints you will surprisingly find the whole ordeal a pleasant experience. This took about 2hrs to implement, if i had more to tranfer over I would ahve done so. On that note it was a blessing to see GraphQL working side by side VueX - no crashing of the system. 
## Overall
Stick with one - I do not know vue.js, adding VueX to the mix was like another language. Styling, for a project it is best to keep it simple to begin with. 
GraphQL was fun it would have been cool to have implemented this from the beginning, not smack at the end close to due date.
Learn one frontend framework or stack and when you get a reasonable understanding of the passing of data and feel you have a grasp of lets say React.js then look at others. I felt like I was learning 5 different languages all new to me at once.
